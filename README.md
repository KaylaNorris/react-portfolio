# react-portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this project was to update my portfolio site with React technology. This application can be used to showcase my work while also showing my proficiency with building single page applications. The application also has a contact form that allows users to send me a message along with their email address so I can respond. I also included my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter accounts in the footer to enable users to contact me in various ways.
