      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I was born in Germany but raised in Columbus, Ohio (GO BUCKS!).<br />
                I have a background in Veterinary Technology and Life Insurance Sales. However, I've always had a love
                for all things Design. I enjoy the complexity of making things flow
                in a zen-like manner. With my previous background, I've gained meticulous organizational skills as well
                as genuine interpersonal skills. I am very determined and have a self-directed mindset. I look forward to working
                with you on future projects!
